This is an introduction to DevOps 
### What is DevOps? (add diagram)
![DevOps diagram](image.png)

DevOps refers to combining software development and operations to enhance the speed, quality and reliability of software. It revolves highly around collaboration and automation of delivery. The aim is to generate continuous integration, testing and deployment. A

### Benefits of DevOps? Benefits for businesses?
Some of the benefits include:
- Greater speed and efficiency through automation and collaboration
- High quality - continuous integration and testing allows us to catch issues early in the development process
- Agile/ flexible - helps businesses to repond to changes quickly and as needed
- Reduces costs - buisnesses can save on costs linked to errors and downtime 

### What does the role entail?
The role can vary, but in general the role is about bridging the gap between the development and operations teams:
- Automate software
- Design and implement monitoring and logging systems 
- Collaborate with teams to identify and resolve issues with development, tooling, and infrastructure


### Who do DevOps Engineers work with?
DevOps engineers work with a range of stakeholders including:
- Developers
- Operations
- Quality assurance teams 
- Project managers
- Information security teams 


### What other teams does a DevOps Engineer interact with?
They may also interact with:
- Business stakeholder e.g. sales and marketing teams 
- Customer support
- Human resources 
- Product management teams 

### What are their common deliverables (what would they be expected to do on day to day basis)?
1) Infrastructure as code - may use tools e.g. Terraform or Ansible to make and manage infrastructure in a automated way
2) Make and implement automated pipelines that allows teh delivery and itegration of software from different environments
3) Use monitoring and logging systems to look at the reliability and availability of software systems
4) Mangae security controls e.g. firewalls
5) Manage tools for collaboration across teams
6) Create and manage documentation to help others understand DevOps practices and tools

### What is the value of a DevOps Engineer?
 By automating processes, putting monitoring and logging systems in place, and managing teh security and compliance of systems, they allow organisations to deliver software quickly and with great reliability and quality.

### How do DevOps Engineers fit into the SDLC?
Here are a few ways that they fit ito the software development lice cycle (SDLC):
- Involved in the planning and designing phase to ensure that software is developed according to DevOps best practices. 
- Work with developers to make sure that the codes made are easily deployable and testable 
- May work with quality assurance teams to check that software is tested properly and that automation is used
- Responsible for automating the deployment process 
- Responsible for the continuous operation and maintainance of software 

### Where can you progress from here?
There are many paths that DevOps engineers can progress to:
- Cloud engineer - design, deploy and manage cloud-based infrastruvture
- DevOps manager - Manage a team of DevOps engineers and make sure that practices are being implemented effectively
- Software engineer - if they have a background in software engineering, they could proceed to this path
- Site reliability engineer - responsible for making sure that systems are reliable and available 


### What is Cloud Computing?
This refers to technology that allows us to access computing resources using the internet whenever we want (on-demand). The resouces may be e.g. computing power, storage, and software applications. 

These can be accessed uing a web browser or API. 

### Who is using DevOps? â€“ Case studies (2-4 total, simple overview of how they use it, no need for depth).

1) Netflix - uses DevOps to rapidly deploy new features and updates to it's streaming service 
2) Amazon - offers a range of DevOps related services such as tools for continuous integrations and delivery. It also has its own DevOps methodoogy called "Amazonian Engineering" which emphasises on collaboration, automation, and continuos improvement
